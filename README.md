#Overview
=============================================================================================

This project involves the implementation of a custom printf function in the C programming language. 
The printf function is a standard library function in C used for formatted output.
The goal here is to create a simplified version of the printf function from scratch, gaining a deeper understanding of its inner workings and the underlying concepts of variadic functions and format specifiers.

#Compilation
=============================================================================================

Code will be compiled this way:
'''
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
'''
As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of the project.
